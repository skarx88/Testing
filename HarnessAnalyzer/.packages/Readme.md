# About

- ~~In this folder are the pre-downloaded package (prerequesite) - files.~~
- ~~Theese files are only needed for starting the sandbox from zstart faster.~~
- ~~If packages are not correct you can delete them to let the script decide~~
- The Sandbox run-script will automatically download the missing packges (if online available)
- The content was replaced by download links to reduce zstart (download)/container size
